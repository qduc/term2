# Turn model and tool boundaries

`TurnModel` owns the root physical request lifecycle: steering, request preparation,
continuity/recovery, root stream acceptance and the native model-call boundary. Its
public constructor and `run`, `compact`, and `clear` methods are the engine-facing
contract used by `turn.ts`.

`TurnCompaction` owns a private compaction proposal and its auxiliary summary/native
requests. It receives the root-owned auxiliary preparation callback so summary work
uses the same model-step, budget, recovery and dispatch boundary without gaining
root tool authority. A replacement changes history only after the `history_replaced`
event is accepted; only then does it clear continuity and retain compaction state.

`TurnTools` owns provider-order scheduling, execution admission and selected-stop
policy. `TurnToolInteractions` owns only execution-scoped interaction publication,
durable readiness and matching answer waits. It cannot select or start work; that
policy remains in `TurnTools`, preserving selected-stop matching and ordered result
publication.
